# Cardano HW cli tool

Cardano HW CLI tool for signing transaction

The command-line interface is based on the official [Cardano-CLI tool](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/reference/cardano-node-cli-reference.html).

# Installation
Check:
- releases https://github.com/vacuumlabs/cardano-hw-cli/releases
- installation instructions https://github.com/vacuumlabs/cardano-hw-cli/blob/develop/docs/installation.md

# Usage
For running commands with ledger, you might need to use `sudo`

## Generate public verification key and hardware wallet signing file
```
cardano-hw-cli address key-gen
--path PATH                     Derivation path to the key we want to sign with.
--verification-key-file FILE    Output filepath of the verification key.
--hw-signing-file FILE          Output filepath of the hardware wallet signing file.
--derivation-type TYPE          Derivation type - currently applies only to Trezor. Options: LEDGER, ICARUS or ICARUS_TREZOR (default).
```
Arguments can be specified multiple times for bulk export.

## Generate public verification key
```
cardano-hw-cli key verification-key
--hw-signing-file FILE          Input filepath of the hardware wallet signing file.
--verification-key-file FILE    Output filepath of the verification key.
```

## Witness transaction
```
cardano-hw-cli transaction witness
--tx-file FILE                         Input filepath of the tx. Use --cddl-format when building transactions with cardano-cli.
--hw-signing-file FILE                 Input filepath of the hardware wallet signing file (one or more files can be specified).
--change-output-key-file FILE          Input filepath of the hardware wallet signing file (so hw cli can match the keys of the change address, if present, and let the device hide it).
--mainnet | --testnet-magic NATURAL    Use the mainnet magic id or specify testnet magic id.
--out-file FILE                        Output filepath of the witness (one or more witness files can be specified).
--derivation-type TYPE                 Derivation type - currently applies only to Trezor. Options: LEDGER, ICARUS or ICARUS_TREZOR (default).
```

## Validate transaction
Verifies whether the tx file complies with [restrictions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0021/README.md) imposed by hardware wallets.
```
cardano-hw-cli transaction validate
--tx-file FILE                         Input filepath of the tx. Use --cddl-format when building transactions with cardano-cli.
```
Exit code meaning:
- `0` transaction complies with all restrictions
- `1` an error occured (e.g. the transaction could not be parsed)
- `2` transaction contains validation errrors that cannot be fixed automatically (e.g. too many tx inputs)
- `3` transaction contains validation errrors that can be fixed by running `transaction transform` (e.g. non-canonical CBOR)

## Transform transaction
Tries to non-destructively transform the tx file, so that it complies with [restrictions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0021/README.md) imposed by hardware wallets.
```
cardano-hw-cli transaction transform
--tx-file FILE                         Input filepath of the tx. Use --cddl-format when building transactions with cardano-cli.
--out-file FILE                        Output filepath of the tx.
```

## Show address on device
```
cardano-hw-cli address show
--payment-path PAYMENTPATH    Payment derivation path.
--staking-path STAKINGPATH    Stake derivation path.
--address-file ADDRESS        Input filepath of the address.
--derivation-type TYPE        Derivation type - currently applies only to Trezor. Options: LEDGER, ICARUS or ICARUS_TREZOR (default).
```

## Issue operational certificate
```
cardano-hw-cli node issue-op-cert
--kes-verification-key-file FILE                     Input filepath of the file with KES vkey.
--operational-certificate-issue-counter FILE         Input filepath of the issue counter file. This option is DEPRECATED. Please use --operational-certificate-issue-counter-file instead.
--operational-certificate-issue-counter-file FILE    Input filepath of the file with certificate counter.
--kes-period UINT64                                  Kes period for the certificate.
--out-file FILE                                      Output filepath for node certificate.
--hw-signing-file FILE                               Input filepath of the hardware wallet signing file.
```

## CIP36 voting registration
```
cardano-hw-cli vote registration-metadata
--mainnet | --testnet-magic NATURAL    Use the mainnet magic id or specify testnet magic id.
--vote-public-key-jcli FILE            Input filepath to vote public key in ed25519extended format (one or more keys can be provided).
